# Troubleshooting

Every footgun we hit, with the working fix.

## Tailscale / DNS

### Short hostnames (`macbook-air`) resolve, FQDNs (`macbook-air.<tailnet>.ts.net`) don't

Homebrew's `tailscaled` doesn't install a resolver entry for the `ts.net`
domain. `install.sh` writes `/etc/resolver/ts.net` to fix this. If you've
already run the installer and it's still broken:

```bash
# Confirm the file exists and has the right content
sudo cat /etc/resolver/ts.net
# Expected:
#   nameserver 100.100.100.100
#   search_order 1
#   timeout 5

# Verify macOS sees it
scutil --dns | grep -A4 'domain   : ts.net'
# Should show nameserver[0] : 100.100.100.100

# Force-refresh
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
```

`dig` and `host` bypass macOS's resolver — they'll still return NXDOMAIN
even when everything is working. Verify with `dscacheutil -q host -a name
<fqdn>` instead.

### Short hostnames broken after manual cleanup

There's a second resolver file, `/etc/resolver/search.tailscale`, that
`tailscaled` generates on startup. It's a 52-byte stub for a pseudo
search domain — it *looks* dead but it's load-bearing for short-name
resolution. **Don't delete it.** If you already did:

```bash
sudo brew services restart tailscale
```

That re-creates it.

### `tailscale set --ssh` says "Tailscale SSH server does not run in
sandboxed Tailscale GUI builds"

You have the App Store or macsys Tailscale build installed. Replace it
with the open-source CLI build:

```bash
# Quit the GUI app first.
brew install tailscale
sudo brew services start tailscale
sudo tailscale up --ssh
```

### Connection refused on `:22` even though `RunSSH=true`

If `tailscale debug prefs` shows `"RunSSH": true` but `nc -v <tailnet-ip>
22` returns "Connection refused", and `tailscaled.log` shows the daemon
finishing startup with no SSH-related lines at all, your tailnet ACL is
missing SSH rules.

Tailscale's SSH server only binds `:22` on the tailnet IP if the
control-plane-delivered `SSHPolicy` contains at least one rule that
could apply to the node. Confirm with:

```bash
sudo tailscale debug netmap | python3 -c \
  'import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); p=d.get("SSHPolicy") or {}; \
   print("rules:", len(p.get("Rules",[])))'
```

If that prints `rules: 0`, fix it in the ACL editor at
<https://login.tailscale.com/admin/acls/file>. A minimum rule that lets
the tailnet owner SSH into their own nodes as any non-root user:

```json
{
  "ssh": [
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src":    ["autogroup:member"],
      "dst":    ["autogroup:self"],
      "users":  ["autogroup:nonroot"]
    }
  ]
}
```

`tailscaled` picks up the new policy within seconds — no restart needed.

This bites hard when you migrate from "plain SSH over Tailscale" (relies
on macOS Remote Login + OpenSSH on `:22`) to "Tailscale SSH server"
(replaces `sshd`). If Remote Login was masking the missing ACL, things
look fine until something turns Remote Login off — then `:22` falls off
the network entirely. Symptoms of this transition:

- `ssh user@host` from a peer prints `Connection refused`
- `tailscale ssh user@host` from the *same* host returns `Connection refused`
- `nc -v 100.x.x.x 57739` (peerapi) succeeds — proves the tun is up
- `tailscaled.log` has zero `handling conn` or `ssh-conn-` lines since startup
- `tailscale debug netmap` shows `"cap/ssh"` present but `SSHPolicy.Rules` empty

### Tailscale SSH from the host to its own tailnet IP returns "refused"

Expected behavior on macOS — not a bug. `ssh dfrysinger@macbook-air`
from the same Mac that's hosting tailscaled gets routed through the OS
network stack (because macOS sees the tailnet IP as a local address on
the utun interface) instead of through tailscaled's netstack, so it
never reaches the Tailscale SSH server. Always test from a peer (your
phone, another laptop) — that's the real network path.

## tmux

### Files outside ~/ are "Operation not permitted" inside tmux

tmux needs Full Disk Access — see `fda-grants.md`. Symptom is specific
to tmux: `ls ~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox` works in a plain SSH shell
and fails inside `tmux new-session`.

### tmux session disappears after Mac reboots

tmux sessions are in-memory; they don't survive reboots. The wrapper
resumes the backend CLI's session on next launch — Copilot via a
stable `--session-id=<uuid>`; Claude Code via `claude --continue` when
the workspace has an existing session under `~/.claude/projects/`.
Either way the conversation comes back; tmux scrollback is gone.

## Backend CLIs

### Slow startup before Copilot opens

The launcher scans `workspace.yaml` metadata to choose the session to resume.
It checks every session file for changes and reuses cached metadata when the
file is unchanged. New or changed files are read with eight parallel readers.
The first scan builds the cache; later scans report how many entries were
reused, read, or skipped, along with elapsed time. Longer scans report progress
about every two seconds as work completes. Disk contention and system load can
still increase lookup time.

Sessions with recorded work take priority over empty sessions; the most recently
updated session in that group wins. The retirement list is read on each launch.
The cache never stores a winning session ID.

The disposable cache is
`${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/remote-agent-stack/copilot-sessions-v1.json`.
Remove that one file to force a full metadata read on the next launch.
Missing or invalid caches are rebuilt automatically. If the cache cannot be
saved, the launcher uses fresh metadata without blocking startup. If metadata
keeps changing during a read, it falls back to an uncached scan and does not
publish that snapshot. No background service is required.

The next message identifies the login-keychain unlock step. If a password
prompt appears there, enter the login-keychain password in that terminal.
This wait is separate from session lookup and Copilot startup.

### Copilot: "store token in plain text config file?" on every launch

Answer "Yes". Reasoning: the Copilot CLI defaults to the macOS keychain,
which is unreliable over SSH — the keychain prompts the GUI for unlock,
which there's no human to dismiss, and the keychain remains locked. The
plaintext fallback lives at `~/.copilot/config.json` with mode 0600,
inside the FileVault-encrypted home volume. The risk delta over the
keychain is small; the operational benefit is large.

### Claude Code: authentication on first launch inside tmux

The first `agent-stack claude <name>` opens Claude Code's in-terminal login flow. Follow
the prompts to sign in; the token lands under `~/.claude/` and
subsequent launches reuse it. If auth silently fails, the most common
cause is the same PATH issue as Copilot below — `claude` isn't on the
non-login shell's PATH.

### Backend binary exits immediately with no UI (`copilot` or `claude`)

If Copilot reports an unsupported `--remote` option, update the Agent Stack
launcher. It launches Copilot with `--session-id` and does not require a
remote-control flag.

For either backend, check that the binary is on PATH inside tmux. Run these
commands from an active tmux session:

```bash
which copilot   # or: which claude
echo "$PATH"
```

If empty, either install the backend CLI to a standard PATH location
or add its install dir to `~/.zshenv` so non-login shells see it.
`~/.zshrc` is *not* enough — tmux launches non-login,
non-interactive shells for `send-keys`.

## Keychain

### Credential prompts inside tmux over SSH

The wrapper calls `security unlock-keychain` once before starting the
new tmux session. That unlocks the login keychain for the whole user
session, so anything launched inside tmux (`gh`, `git`, `ssh-add`, the
AWS CLI, Slack tokens, etc.) can read its stored secrets normally.

If the keychain re-locks later (e.g., the machine sleeps, or you have a
short idle-lock policy), just run `security unlock-keychain` once inside
tmux. Type your login password and you're back in business.

## Termius

### Termius iOS connection prompt loops / "connection failed"

Symptom: tapping a host on Termius iOS pops a "Username / Password /
Key" prompt mid-connection, and submitting blanks gives "connection
failed."

Cause: the **username** on the host config is empty or doesn't match a
real macOS user. Tailscale SSH authenticates by tailnet identity, but
the username still has to map to a real OS user the ACL allows
(`autogroup:nonroot` covers any non-root user).

Fix: set the username on the host (or its Mac group) to the value
`whoami` prints on the Mac. The password field can stay blank —
Tailscale SSH ignores it.

### Pasting from phone corrupts multi-line snippets with null bytes

Termius's iOS clipboard handler occasionally injects `^@` (null) bytes
into pasted content. Symptom is commands silently failing or only
running the first line of a heredoc.

Use the single-line wrapper (`agent-stack <backend> <Name>`) instead of
multi-line shell snippets. If
you still need to paste something multi-line from your phone, put it
in a text file (TextEdit, Dropbox-synced) and `cat` it on the Mac
instead.

## Managed devices

### macOS keeps disabling Remote Login / Screen Sharing

This was the original reason for the now-removed `watchdog` daemon. If
you see this again on this stack, **don't bring the watchdog back** —
it fought with MDM and lost. Switch to Tailscale SSH (`sudo tailscale up
--ssh`) which is what this stack uses, and let macOS's built-in Remote
Login stay off.
